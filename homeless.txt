8 correlations

second meeting:
Static:
coffee, shelters, bus stops, 2015 gen pop, library count, ralphs, trader joes and whole foods counts, restaurant count,
affordable housing units

Homeless Population:
vehicle, street, shelter and grand total 2015, 2016, 2017

Dynamics:
AM-AT, BK-CQ, CR-CT, CU-CX, DC-DE, DF-EI

mixture of gaussians:
for pre and post VIF

Correlation analysis:
1. Dynamic features and how it changes and also how homeless pop in general how it relates to features.
2. Static analysis, each 4 homeless pop for each year with static features with dynamic features at that year
   For each of the dynamic features that have all 3 years do as the same
   If not, for the dynamic feature we use the data for the previous year
   for e.g, 2017 street pop, use all the static features and use all ZRI,ZHVI for 2017 and all the dynamic features 
   from 2016
3. Dynamic analysis, look at the change in homeless population from 2015-2017 and how that correlates with all
   the statics and the largest change we can observe from 2015 on. Can safely take the difference.
4. print all the correlation coefficients
